# DirStructureMerge
Merge 2 partial directory structures (for example, downloaded from Google Drive/Backup &amp; Sync)

Don' forget to create a directory called "output" in the same root directory as the 2 directories you'd like to merge!

TODO: Optimise for speed, by modifying to simply copy 2nd-selected directory structure into 1st, saving the time and space consumed cloning the contents of the 1st directory.
